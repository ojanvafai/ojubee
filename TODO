-Cache the individual thermostat data and update async so tab transitions are fast if you want to just modify the setting. Maybe periodically have server sync so it's always up to date?
-put resume at the bottom with what the current override is. Don't show if there's no override.
-Have a selector for what action to take (2hr, 4hr, hold, next schedule)
-Move token refresh to a cron instead of in the critical path for login redirects
-Sync currentTemp on visibilitychange-->visible, on focus, on updating temp
-Switch resume schedule to use XHR as well
-Show sensors in addition to the average number
-Update README
-Make URLs put human readable thermostat name without the /thermostats/
-Add fan on/off
-Limit desired temp values to the Runtime.desiredCoolRange/Runtime.desiredHeatRange range.
