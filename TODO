v1
-Add fan on/off
-Move token refresh to a cron instead of in the critical path for login redirects
-Cache list of thermostats in the datastore/memcache

v2
-Load all the state via JSON
-Do a proper appshell w serviceworker and offline
-Make changing thermostats do in-page refresh
-Don't hide the nav-bar on transitions, but still don't show the main thermostat content
 until the json has loaded.
-Make URLs put human readable thermostat name without the /thermostats/
-Limit desired temp values to the Runtime.desiredCoolRange/Runtime.desiredHeatRange range.
-If the last update time is not recent, put it on the page somewhere.
-Have a selector for what action to take (2hr, 4hr, hold, next schedule)
-Don't show resume if there's no override
-Cache the individual thermostat data and update async so tab transitions are fast if you want to just modify the setting. Maybe periodically have server sync so it's always up to date?
-Allow changing mode
