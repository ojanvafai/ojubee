- stale-while-revalidate the list of thermostats and refresh cron instead of perma-caching it in localStorage
- Make refresh token cron work
- require login so random people can't change our HVAC settings
- Add ability to change schedule
- Add ability to set vacation

Polish
- Show loading animation when refreshing auth when app not registered
- Style select elements to not be quite so ugly
- Make sure offline mostly works (e.g. that the fetch handlers do the right thing and the UI shows as offline)


Perf
- do refresh token during idle time for faster page load? does that make sense even?

Code health
- Move config stuff to a different file so others can fork and use it too
- Update README.md and TODO files
- cleanup all the global code into modules
- load ecobee-api as a module
- move stylesheets into actual files?
