v2
-Limit desired temp values to the Runtime.desiredCoolRange/Runtime.desiredHeatRange range.
-If the last update time is not recent, put it on the page somewhere.
-Periodically have server sync thermostat data so it's always up to date and push changes using ServiceWorker + budget API.
-Allow changing mode

v3
-Use fetch everywhere instead of xhr
-Make into SPA so page transitions can be less jarring.
-Change ojubee page to load state via JSON so it's not incorrectly cached indefinitely
if the thermostat list changes.
