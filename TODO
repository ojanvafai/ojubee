-Put up on appengine
-Allow hitting +/- multiple times in a row
-Cache the individual thermostat data and update async so tab transitions are fast if you want to just modify the setting. Maybe periodically have server sync so it's always up to date?
-Color code the hot and cold temps/buttons
-put the temp buttons on top of the hot/cold values
-put current temp between hot/cold
-put resume at the bottom with what the current override is. Don't show if there's no override.
-Have a selector for what action to take (2hr, 4hr, hold, next schedule)
