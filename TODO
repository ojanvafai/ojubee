- store tokens in a global and/or localstorage since we now fallback to refreshing on errors.
- await refreshAuth on errors before falling back to the pin page
- Only refesh auth in error cases and at most 1x/min after successful updates?

- Make refresh token cron work
- enable SW caching, make favicon work, make add to homescreen work, delete the public directory
- require login so random people can't change our HVAC settings
- Make sure offline mostly works (e.g. that the fetch handlers do the right thing)
- Add ability to change schedule
- Add ability to set vacation

Polish
- Show loading animation when refreshing auth when app not registered
- Style select elements to not be quite so ugly

Perf
- stale-while-revalidate the list of thermostats to avoid jank in navbar
- do refresh token during idle time for faster page load? does that make sense even?

Code health
- Move config stuff to a different file so others can fork and use it too
- Update README.md and TODO files
- cleanup all the global code into modules
- load ecobee-api as a module
- move stylesheets into actual files?
