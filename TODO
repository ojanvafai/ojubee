v1
-Add fan on/off
-Sync currentTemp on visibilitychange-->visible, on focus, on updating temp
-After updating temp, get new values and retry if the update hit the off-by-n error
-Switch resume schedule to use XHR as well
-Move token refresh to a cron instead of in the critical path for login redirects

v2
-Make URLs put human readable thermostat name without the /thermostats/
-Limit desired temp values to the Runtime.desiredCoolRange/Runtime.desiredHeatRange range.
-If the last update time is not recent, put it on the page somewhere.
-Have a selector for what action to take (2hr, 4hr, hold, next schedule)
-Don't show resume if there's no override
-Cache the individual thermostat data and update async so tab transitions are fast if you want to just modify the setting. Maybe periodically have server sync so it's always up to date?
-Allow changing mode
